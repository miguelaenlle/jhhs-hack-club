# Stuff Finder

Welcome to the stuff finder workshop! 👋

For the next few meetups, you’ll build a custom “stuff finder website”! 🔥 This requires **no prior experience** & we'll provide tutorials for all features you'd like to add

We’ll first show you how to build a basic ice cream finder: \

\
Then, you’ll be able to customize to your liking! \
\
For example, you can build:

_• An ice cream store finder_ \
